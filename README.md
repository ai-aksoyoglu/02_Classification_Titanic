<h2 align="center">Predicting Titanic Passenger Survival  
    <h2 align="center">with Supervised Machine Learning, by Logistic Regression (Classification)
</h2>

__1) The Goal:__ Build a machine learning model that is able to predict which of the passengers of the Titanic has survived or not.  
__2) Get the Data:__ The data is given.  
__3) Split the Data:__ The data is already split: "train.csv" and "test.csv".  
__4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__  
__5)-9) Feature Engineering (FE), Train Model, Optimize Hyperparameters/Cross-Validation__

- Train a Logistic Regression classification model (alternative models: Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Create features using one-hot encoding
- Calculate the train and test accuracy
- Calculate a cross-validation score
- Train a Random Forest classification model

__10) Calculate Test Score:__ Use the test data set aside to calculate the test score.

__11) Deploy and Monitor:__ Submit your prediction to Kaggle.
